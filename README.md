# AngularCLJS Todo App

A very simple todo list trying to see how I can use [AngularJS][1] with [ClojureScript][2]. I'm also using
[Purnam][3] to make some of the JavaScript interop a little easier.

### build the app

  $ lein cljsbuild once

### running the specs

  $ lein cljsbuild auto dev

### try out the app

After starting the auto runner you can test the app by opening `index.html`
